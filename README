Description:
	- This is an open source web app HTML + CSS template that looks slightly Googl-y. 
	- It's very simple: no images, no javscript, very simple CSS. 
	- It's a starting point, not a destination. 
	- Just enough to start using, nothing to throw away.
	
License: 
	- whatever license is more open and legal, including commercial use.
	
Author:
	- first version Dec 2010 by http://petervandijck.com
	
Note: For overall layout, we use YUI Grids http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/
	
To Do:
	- Make sure the main content space fills out vertically until the bottom of the screen.
	- Improve naming.
	- Make list of items a <ol> or <ul>. Keep the lists simple, nothing fancy.
	- Add bits and pieces.
	- Make menu a little nicer with hover states perhaps.
	- Better comments.
	
Tested on:
	- Google Chrome 9.0 beta (Windows 7)
	
Do NOT add:
	- Images.
	- Javascript.
	- CSS for forms.
	- Fancy lists of items.
	- It's not meant to be finished, it's meant to be an easy starting point. Keep it simple.
	
Share and enjoy!
